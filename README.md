## Analyzing Uber Pickup Patterns in New York City
 
In my project, I worked with Uber datasets that were stored in CSV files. The first step was to import these datasets. Next, I focused on cleaning the data. This involved removing duplicate entries and dealing with any missing values. Once the data was clean, I proceeded with data preparation and analysis.

I started by looking at which months had the highest number of Uber pickups in New York City. I represented this information visually using a bar graph. Additionally, I examined the number of pickups on each weekday for every month. This helped me understand the patterns of Uber pickups over different days.

To dive deeper, I investigated the rush hours in New York City throughout the entire day. To present this information effectively, I used a point plot. This allowed me to visualize the peak hours for Uber rides.

Furthermore, I analyzed the active vehicles for each base number. Using a box plot distribution chart, I displayed the distribution of active vehicles across different base numbers, identifying the most active ones.

Taking it a step further, I created a heatmap to explore the rush hours based on both the hour of the day and the weekday. This pairwise analysis provided insights into the busiest hours on different days.

In conclusion, my project involved importing Uber datasets from CSV files, cleaning the data, preparing it for analysis, and then performing a series of analyses to uncover trends in Uber pickups in New York City. I used various visualization techniques, such as bar graphs, point plots, box plots, and heatmaps, to present the insights I gained from the data.

The heatmap portrays the interplay between weekdays and hours for Uber pickups. Observations reveal weekday patterns. Midweek, Wednesday stands out with consistent high demand from morning to early evening, suggesting steady usage. Fridays showcase a spike during the afternoon, perhaps due to weekend preparations. Weekends display a more relaxed yet persistent demand. Hours, like 6 PM on weekdays, exhibit heightened activity, hinting at post-work travel. Despite variations, the morning hours generally exhibit low demand. This analysis emphasizes the interdependence of weekdays and hours on Uber pickups, allowing for targeted strategies to optimize resource allocation and improve user experience
