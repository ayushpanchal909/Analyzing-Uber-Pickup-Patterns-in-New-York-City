## Uber-Analysis

In my project, I worked with Uber datasets that were stored in CSV files. The first step was to import these datasets. Next, I focused on cleaning the data. This involved removing duplicate entries and dealing with any missing values. Once the data was clean, I proceeded with data preparation and analysis.

I started by looking at which months had the highest number of Uber pickups in New York City. I represented this information visually using a bar graph. Additionally, I examined the number of pickups on each weekday for every month. This helped me understand the patterns of Uber pickups over different days.

To dive deeper, I investigated the rush hours in New York City throughout the entire day. To present this information effectively, I used a point plot. This allowed me to visualize the peak hours for Uber rides.

Furthermore, I analyzed the active vehicles for each base number. Using a box plot distribution chart, I displayed the distribution of active vehicles across different base numbers, identifying the most active ones.

Taking it a step further, I created a heatmap to explore the rush hours based on both the hour of the day and the weekday. This pairwise analysis provided insights into the busiest hours on different days.

In conclusion, my project involved importing Uber datasets from CSV files, cleaning the data, preparing it for analysis, and then performing a series of analyses to uncover trends in Uber pickups in New York City. I used various visualization techniques, such as bar graphs, point plots, box plots, and heatmaps, to present the insights I gained from the data.

### Objective of Analysis

>Which month experienced the highest number of Uber pickups in New York City?

>Which weekday shows the highest Uber pickups on average throughout the various months in New York City?

>At what hours of the day do we observe the highest and lowest Uber pickup activity in New York City, and how does this pattern differ across weekdays?

>Which base number exhibits the highest median count of active vehicles, and how does the distribution of active vehicles vary among different base numbers?

>What are the peak hours during each weekday for Uber pickups in New York City, and how does the heatmap reveal variations in pickup trends across different days and hours?
